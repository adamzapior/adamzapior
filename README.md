#### My opensource projects
Some modules in applications may be hidden and unavailable in the public repository.

- [_BetTracker_ - bets analyzer](https://github.com/adamzapior/BetTracker) - mobile app to maintain all of your betting activity in one interface. With features like tax rates, this software enables you personalise your experience whether you're tracking a single wager or an entire slip, giving you a precise idea of your possible earnings. It has an option to export your betting history into a spreadsheet and timely notifications to make sure you're always aware of your bets.

  **Created with:** Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, GRDB, Local notifications, UserDefaults + MVVM architecture

- [_Pitlane_- F1 stats tracker](https://github.com/adamzapior/Pitlane) - simple Formula 1 stats tracker based on public Ergast API. The main goal of the application was to implement DTO and programmatic UI, which adapts to different font sizes (accessibility).

  **Created with:** Swift, UIKit, Alamofire, 3rd party libraries: SnapKit, FlagKit + MVC architecture
