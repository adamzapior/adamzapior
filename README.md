## üëã Hi, I'm Adam 

I am aspiring junior iOS developer with prior experience in banking and sales. My immediate goal is to further hone my skills in Swift and find employment as an iOS developer. I am open to all opportunities that will allow me to gain my first commercial experience.

## üì± Projects 

My primary project is the ![BetTracker](https://github.com/adamzapior/BetTracker) - app designed for recording and analyzing betting statistics.
I have significantly expanded my knowledge of SwiftUI and the Combine library through the creation of this application. I'd like to extend an invitation for you to look over the project, get more information, and examine my code.

I'm currently working on the Pitlane app, a project that will help me learn more about UIKit and how to use REST APIs. I would also like to expand my knowledge of Core Data.
