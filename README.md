## üëã Hi, I'm Adam 

I am aspiring junior iOS developer with prior experience in banking and sales. My immediate goal is to further hone my skills in Swift and find employment as an iOS developer. I am open to all opportunities that will allow me to gain my first commercial experience.

## üì± Projects 

‚û§ [BetTracker - bets analyzer](https://github.com/adamzapior/BetTracker) - my first public app created for portfolio and AppStore, designed for recording and analyzing betting statistics.
In the future, I want to focus on adding new features - mainly better statistics with SwiftCharts and WidgetKit. 

**Technologies:** _Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, GRDB, Local notifications, UserDefaults + MVVM architecture_

#

‚û§ [Pitlane - F1 stats tracker](https://github.com/adamzapior/Pitlane) - simple Formula 1 stats tracker based on public Ergast API. The main goal of the application was to implement DTO and programmatic UI, which adapts to different font sizes (accessibility).

**Technologies:** _Swift, UIKit, Alamofire, 3rd party libraries: SnapKit, FlagKit + MVC architecture_

# 

‚û§ [Yem - recipe manager with shoping list](https://github.com/adamzapior/Yem) - work in progress

**Technologies:** _Swift, UIKit, Combine, CoreData + MVVM architecture_
